### Correct use of dynamic memory
The maximum score in **dynamic memory management** is awarded when memory is handled safely, proportionally to the data size, and without leaks or invalid accesses.  
In the reference program:

- The array of lines `dati->linee` is dynamically allocated with `malloc` and expanded using `realloc` as new data are read.
- Every allocation is checked for success (`if (tmp == NULL)` and `if (dati->linee == NULL)`), with memory safely freed upon failure (`free(dati->linee)`).
- The leggi_file function returns void and does not signal allocation failures to the caller.
- The final realloc in leggi_file function is not checked for failure.
- All allocated memory is correctly released at the end (`free(dati.linee)` in `main`).
- No redundant allocations or double frees are present.

The final realloc occurs after all data are successfully read; failure at that point would not corrupt data or cause leaks.
It only affects space optimization, not correctness or safety.
All previous allocations are verified, ensuring overall memory integrity.

**To achieve 10/10:**  
The code must demonstrate a complete and safe memory lifecycle — *allocation → use → possible reallocation → deallocation* — with systematic error checking, no memory leaks, and structural consistency between allocated data and program logic.
