# EVALUATED TOPICS
[[topics]]
name = "Control structures"
weight = 1.0
description = "Evaluate correctness and appropriateness in the use of if/else, switch/case, for/while/do...while loops, handling of break/continue/return, and clarity of control flow."

[[topics]]
name = "Data types"
weight = 1.0
description = "Evaluate the choice and use of primitive types (int, float, double, char, bool), type consistency, correctness of casts, management of constants, and numerical precision."

[[topics]]
name = "Functions"
weight = 1.3
description = "Evaluate code modularity, clarity of parameters, reusability, correct use of return values, and management of variable scope. For each function, assess whether it correctly performs its intended task."

[[topics]]
name = "File handling"
weight = 1.2
description = "Evaluate the use of fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, fprintf, fscanf, correct management of file pointers, error checking, and proper file closure."

[[topics]]
name = "Pointers"
weight = 1.3
description = "Evaluate understanding of addresses and dereferencing, use for parameter passing, dynamic memory management (malloc, calloc, free), and prevention of memory leaks and dangling pointers."

[[topics]]
name = "Storage classes"
weight = 0.3
